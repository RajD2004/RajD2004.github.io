My name is Sairaj (Raj) Dhullipalla, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Michigan State University. From a young age, I have been passionate about solving complex problems and understanding how things work. This natural curiosity led me to explore technology as a tool to create solutions that have real-world impact.

I am particularly interested in backend development, algorithms, and systems programming. I have experience with various programming languages, including Python, C++, and Java, and have worked on a variety of projects that demonstrate my technical skills. I am constantly looking to improve my knowledge by working on challenging projects, both academic and personal.

Beyond technical skills, I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with teams to tackle complex problems. I am driven by the desire to build scalable and efficient software solutions that make a difference in people's lives.
