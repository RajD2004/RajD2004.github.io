This website contains information about me, Sairaj Dhullipalla. The about me section is going to refer you to my skills and credentials, whereas the my projects page has some of the coding projects I have done over the years. I am passionate about science, mathematics, and technology. I like to read, watch movies and shows on Netflix, work out at the gym, and hiking.
